# GSAP Image Trail Experience

## Overview

This project is an experimental interactive image trail experience built with JavaScript and GSAP.  
It explores how motion, timing, and user input can be combined to create a fluid and immersive visual interaction.

The experience reacts to mouse movement, generating a trail of images that appear, animate, and disappear smoothly, creating a dynamic sense of flow.

## Concept

The goal of this project was to experiment with motion-driven interactions rather than static UI elements.  
By linking animations directly to the user’s cursor, the interface becomes more expressive and alive.

This project acts as a creative playground between front-end development and motion design.
